        <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
        wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
        the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
        Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
        everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
        to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period
        was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
        insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
        degree of comparison only.
        There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on
        the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen
        with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
        than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
        things in general were settled for ever.
        It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
        seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that
        favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her
        five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in
        the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing
        that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and
        Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round
        dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very
        year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.
        Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:
        which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race
        than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of
        the Cock-lane brood.

        <p>In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
        justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
        highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families
        were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their
        furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in
        the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
        challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
        “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
        mall was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
        then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mall was robbed in peace; that
        magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
        and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
        illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols
        fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves
        snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court
        drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers
        fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much
        out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
        and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
        up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker
        on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in
        the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the 
        door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s
        boy of sixpence.

        <p>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and
        close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked
        unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain
        and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
        with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and
        seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—
        the creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay
        before them</p>
