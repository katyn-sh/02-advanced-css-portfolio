        <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
        wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
        the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
        Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
        everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
        to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period
        was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
        insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
        degree of comparison only.
        There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on
        the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen
        with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
        than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
        things in general were settled for ever.
        It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
        seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that
        favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her
        five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in
        the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing
        that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and
        Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round
        dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very
        year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.
        Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:
        which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race
        than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of
        the Cock-lane brood.
